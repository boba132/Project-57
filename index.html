        <p>In my free time, I'll find my notebook and a sharpened pencil. Drawing holds a special place in my heart. As long as I have a reference, I can create a decent replica of it on paper. I'm in sixth grade at the age of twelve, so now I barely have enough time to draw a simple flower from memory because of the homework. However, I can't really draw in school either because of kids in my class constantly snooping. Either way, I usually find at least thirty minutes a day to just relax and draw! </p>
